h1. Virtual Channels

Even though [MS-RDPERP] mentions a single virtual channel, "rail", the packet capture shows the client registering "rail", "rail_ri" and "rail_wi".

More details about "rail_ri" and "rail_wi" can be found on this "page":http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/os_windowsprotocols/thread/d91b20a2-96af-406c-aa56-085058a0af44/.

h1. Usage

RemoteApp support was introduced in FreeRDP 1.0, so you should get the latest sources from git.

@./client/X11/xfreerdp -u <username> -p <password> --app --plugin channels/rail/rail.so --data "<exe_or_file>:<working_dir>:<arguments>" -- <hostname>@

*exe_or_file*: usually a program alias prefixed with "||", otherwise a full path to an executable file.

*working_dir*: the working directory to use for running the application

*arguments*: arguments to pass to be passed to the application when it is being launched

For instance, if you configure your server to export the command prompt, it will have the "cmd" alias by default. You could then get the windows command prompt with a command like this:

@./client/X11/xfreerdp -u Administrator -p Password --app --plugin channels/rail/rail.so --data "||cmd" -- 192.168.1.200@
