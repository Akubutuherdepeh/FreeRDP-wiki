h1. PandaBoard

The "PandaBoard":http://www.pandaboard.org is a nice development board that can be used for FreeRDP development. For a low-cost device, it offers all that is needed in order to build a thin client. The hardware specifications can be found "here":http://www.pandaboard.org/content/platform. Since the board looked pretty interesting, I applied for a free board (for open source projects only) and I was accepted. I am pretty satisfied with the board and I would recommend it.

h1. Basic Setup

The board comes with nothing else but the board, so you will need additional accessories:

* 4GB+ SD card (a microSD card in an adapter works, SDHC is supported)
* 5V power supply with at least 2A (4A is recommended, 2A worked for me)
* HDMI cable, HDTV or HDMI to DVI adapter + monitor with DVI input
* A USB keyboard + mouse. Wireless keyboard + mouse worked for me

Instructions on how to get started can be found "here":http://pandaboard.org/content/resources/getting-started.

The easiest operating to install first is probably Ubuntu. I followed the instructions "here":http://omappedia.org/wiki/Ubuntu_Pre-built_Binaries_Guide. It's actually pretty simple: download the pre-build ubuntu binaries, and follow the instructions to dd the pre-built image onto your SD card which will then be ready to boot.

Once you are booted on Ubuntu, follow the same instructions as with regular Ubuntu to get xfreerdp up and running. From there, you should be able to use FreeRDP right on your TV:
