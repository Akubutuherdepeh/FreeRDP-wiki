**Please don't "report" questions as bugs**

Found a bug? - We would like to help you and smash the bug away.

**Before reporting** a bug have a look into [our issue tracker](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues) to see if the bug was already reported and you can add some additional information.

If it's a **new bug** - [create a new issue](https://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP/issues/new).  
To save time and help us identify the issue a bug report should at least contain the following:

* an useful description of the bug - "It's not working" isn't good enough - you must try harder ;)
* the steps to reproduce the bug
* command line you have used
* to what system did you connect to? (win8, 2008, ..)
* what did you expect to happen?
* what actually happened?
* freerdp version (e.g. xfreerdp --version) or package version or git commit
* operating System, architecture, distribution e.g. linux, amd64, debian
* if you built it yourself add some notes which branch you have used, also your cmake parameters can help
* extra information helping us to find the bug

If you have question join us in irc (#freerdp on freenode) or write a mail to our mailing list.  

**Thank you for reporting a bug!**
