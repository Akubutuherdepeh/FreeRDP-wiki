## Freerdp shipped with my distribution is rather old - is there a recent version?
For ubuntu there is a [remmina](http://remmina.sourceforge.net/)/freerdp personal package archive available at https://launchpad.net/~freerdp-team/+archive/freerdp which provides daily builds.
For other distributions are currently no daily packages available so you will need to build from source.
