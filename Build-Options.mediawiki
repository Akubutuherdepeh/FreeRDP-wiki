There are several options you can specify when you create the Makefiles/Project Files with cmake. You can see some, but not all, if you use ccmake or the windows equivalent cmake-gui. The ones listed are mostly selfexplanatory, so lets focus her on the ones not listed. A build option WITH_XXX is specified as -DWITH_XXX=ON on the cmake command line.

* MONOLITHIC_BUILD : This will build libfreerdp and libwinpr into one single dll each (requires cmake >= 2.8.8)
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug : Leave this empty or set it to Release for (optimized) Release build
* WITH_SSE2_TARGET : Compile complete code sse2 optimized (-msse2)
* WITH_SSE2 : Add support sse2 optimized codecs (nsc, rfx) detection is done at runtime
* WITH_NEON : Add support neon optimized codecs (rfx) detection is done at runtime
* WITH_THIRD_PARTY : Enable builing of third-party code located in third-party
* WITH_JPEG : Enable jpeg codec
* WITH_X11 : When OFF, don't link against X11 (useful when redistributing library files)
* WITH_CUNIT : When ON, create makefiles for building unit tests, runnable with "make test"
