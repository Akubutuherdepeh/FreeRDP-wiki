There are several options you can specify when you create the Makefiles/Project Files with cmake. You can see some, but not all, if you use ccmake or the windows equivalent cmake-gui. The ones listed are mostly selfexplanatory, so lets focus her on the ones not listed. A build option WITH_XXX is specified as -DWITH_XXX=ON on the cmake command line.

* WITH_MONOLITHIC_BUILD : This will build libfreerdp and libwinpr into one single dll each
* CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug : Leave this empty for (optimized) Release build
* WITH_SSE2_TARGET : Compile complete code sse2 optimized (-msse2)
* WITH_SSE2 : Add support sse2 optimized codecs (nsc, rfx) detection is done at runtime
* WITH_NEON : Add support neon optimized codecs (rfx) detection is done at runtime
* WITH_THIRD_PARTY : Enable builing of third-party code located in third-party
* WITH_JPEG : Enable jpeg codec
