==Prerequisites==

* MS Visual C++ Express 2010 http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/express
* MS SDK http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=8279
* OpenSSL Library http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html
* cmake http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html
* git http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/

If you like working in a shell, get cygwin. You can also use cygwins git, but NOT the cmake that comes with cygwin

==Obtaining the source==
<pre>git clone git://github.com/FreeRDP/FreeRDP.git</pre>

==Preparing the build==
From the command line, go to the directory where you pulled the sources and type
<pre>cmake .</pre>
Of course, you can also run cmake-gui that comes with the windows cmake install and point it to your sources.

== Building ==
In Visual Studio, open the FreeRDP project map and build it. It should build clean.

== Known Problems ==
* you need --sec tls on the command line, this is true for my linux build, too
* colours are garbled unless you say -a 32, this is not true for my linus build
